### Perform In-place Sort an up to 3 different elements

Given that, you need to perform in-place sort for distinct elements <= 3. That time you can use two pointers approach. 

Distinct elements <= 3. So you already know those element orders. One go to left side corner, second goes to right side corner and third element will be in middle. 

Managing (2-3) pointers, I can perform an inplace sorting. 

Most of time, you just need to think about how you fill left side and right side corner and shrink the window/range. You need to swap the elements to do that. 

Think in this direction.
