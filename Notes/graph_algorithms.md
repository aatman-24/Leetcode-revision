## Graphs Algorithm Short Notes

### 

### 1. Depth First Search [O(V+E), O(V)]

```c
void dfs(int node, vector<int> adj[], vector<int> &visited, vector<int> &dfsOrder) {
    visited[node] = 1;              // mark the unvisited node, as visited
    dfsOrder.push_back(node);       // store in dfsOrder
    for (auto it : adj[node]) {     // iterate over all the neighbors node
        if (!visited[it]) {         // If neighbors nodes are not visited perform dfs on that, otherwise skip it, we don't visit the visited node
            dfs(it, adj, visited, dfsOrder);
        }
    }
}

vector<int> depthFirstSearch(int V, vector<int> adj[]) {
    vector<int> visited(V + 1, 0);
    vector<int> dfsOrder;
    for (int i = 1; i <= V; i++) {          // If there are many components in graph, then we need to check for each node.
        if (!visited[i]) {                  // If node is not visited, it means it is from isolated component's node.
            dfs(i, adj, visited, dfsOrder);
        }
    }
    return dfsOrder;
}
```

### 2. Breadth First Search[O(V+E), O(V)]

```c
vector<int> breadthFirstSearch(vector<int> adj[], int V) {

    // keep track of visited node, we don't visit the visited node again
    vector<int> visited(N + 1, 0);

    vector<int> bfsOrder;

    // Need to check for each node, due to disconnect componet is possible in graph.
    for (int i = 1; i <= V; i++) {
        // perform traversal on not visited node only.
        if (!visited[i]) {
            queue<int> q;
            q.push(i);
            visited[i] = 1;
            while (!q.empty()) {
                int node = q.front(); q.pop();
                bfsOrder.push_back(node);
                for (auto it : adj[node]) {
                    // only add if that node is not visited. (To avoid cycle trapping)
                    if (!visited[it]) {
                        q.push(it);
                        visited[it] = 1;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Graph is bipartite using BFSÂ + DFS [O(V+E), O(V)]

```c
 /* Intuition


Intuition behind the algorithm is that, 

    If Graph contain the cycle, and that cycle is odd length, It means one of two adjancents node
    have same color. It is not biparatite graph. 

    If Graph contain no cycle, or have even length cycle, we are find, and grpah is biparatite. 


 */

### 4. Cycle Detection on Undirected Graph Using BFS[O(V+E), O(V)]

```c
 /* Intuition

When we apply bfs/dfs on the graph, during traversal, if we visit neighbors node, and
that is already visited by other node(except the parent), we found cycle.

In undirected graph, we have both edges(forward, reversal), so we don't consider reverse edge which again point to parent,
during travesal, so we keep track of parent, so we can ignore it during as potential neighbors.

```

### 6. Cycle Detection on Directed Graph Using DFS[O(V+E), O(V)]

```c
 /* Intuition

 What is major differnce between the DFS of Directed and Undirected Graph ?

-> So In Un-Directed Graph there is no direction on edge so we consider it as bidirectional. But in the Directed graph,
there is direction given (u, v) as edge, it means edge has direction from u -> v.

Due to that, if one node is visited and again other node try to visit that node doesn't mean that there is cycle...
Ex:

1 -> 2 -> 3
     |    |
     4 -> 5

2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3(Visited) (DFS call 1)
2 -> 3 (Already Visited) but it is not cycle. (DFS call 2)

In directed Graph there is cycle if and only if current node is getting visited two times in same path. If the path is different
then there is no cycle.

Ex:

1 -> 2 <- 3
     |    |
     4 -> 5

Here you can see... 1->2->4->5->3->2(already visited)... in single path(single dfs call) we are getting the same node... it means there is cycle.


Due to that,

We need to keep one more array, pathVisited[] which tells us whether current node is repeated earlier in same path or not. And also
whenever we backtrack that time we also backtrack from pathVisited.

 */
bool dfs(int node, vector<int> adjList[], vector<int> &visited, vector<int> &pathVisited) {

    // mark the current node as visited.
    visited[node] = 1;
    pathVisited[node] = 1;  // also mark the current node as path visited.

    for (auto it : adjList[node]) {

        if (!visited[it]) {
            // check if any of its adjacent node leads to cycle, yes then return true there is cycle.
            if (dfs(it, adjList, visited, pathVisited)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        // node is visited already, check it is visited in same path
        else if (pathVisited[it] == 1) {
            return true
        }
    }

    // backtrack
    pathVisited[node] = 0;  // unwind from pathVisited
    return false;   // cycle notf oudn
}



bool isCycle(vector<int> adjList[], int V) {

    vector<int> visited(V + 1, 0);
    vector<int> pathVisited(V + 1, 0);

    for (int i = 1; i <= V; i++) {
        if (!visited[i]) {
            // check if starting from node i, can lead to cycle
            if (dfs(i, adjList, visited, pathVisited))
                return true;

### 7. BFS on Maze(2D Matrix)(Dungeon Problem)[O(V^2), O(V^2)]

```c
 /* Intuition

 Intuition behind this algo is that,

    We convert the given 2D Matrix(Maze) into the graph, so we can apply the BFS on that.

    Based upon question, we define which node can be neighbors,

        If we allow to move in 4 directions => we have 4 neighbors for any node maximum.

        If we allow to move in 8 directions(diagonal as well) => we have 8 neighbors.

    Simply, we will apply the BFS on maze(we don't convert it to graph), how(check on code).

 */

// We can also unwind the node from the queue based on level(the way we did in tree) whatever level we get when we
// reach the exit point can be consider as shortest distance. Check the code..()

    // maze[i][j] = 1, it means there is rock.
    // maze[i][j] = 2, it means exit cell.

    // To keep track visited cell, so we don't again push to the queue.

            // found the exit point.
            if (maze[x][y] == 2) {
                return true;        // if require minimum_distance then return level... (you get it right...)
            }


            for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {

                int xx = x + dx[i];
                int yy = y + dy[i];

                // out of bound any of parameter skip it.

                visited[xx][yy] = 1;
                q.push({xx, yy});

            }
        }

        level++;
    }

    return false;
}
```

### 8.  Topological sort using DFS [O(V+E), O(V)]

```c
void dfs(int node, vector<int> adjList[], vector<int> &visited, stack<int> &st) {
    visited[node] = 1;
    for (auto it : adjList[node]) {
        if (!visited[it]) {
            dfs(it, adjList, visited, st);
        }
    }
    st.push(node);  // after visting all the neighbours we are adding curr node in stack.
    // which make sure that.... If there is edge U -> V... then stack hold element in this order => U -> V
}

vector<int> topoSort(vector<int> adjList[], int V) {

    vector<int> visited(V + 1, 0);
    stack<int> st;          // contain topo order in right manner.

    for (int i = 1; i <= V; i++) {
        if (!visited[i]) {
            dfs(i, adjList, visited, st);
        }
    }

    // Add the element from the stack to the array....
    vector<int> topologicalOrder;
    while (!st.empty()) {
        topologicalOrder.push_back(st.top());
        st.pop();
    }

}
```

### 9. Topological sort using BFS (Kahn's algorithm) + Cycle Detection [O(V+E), O(V)]

```c
vector<int> topoSort(vector<int> adjList[], int V) {

    vector<int> indegree(V + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i <= V; i++) {

            indegree[it]++;
        }
    }

    // keep track of visited node.
    int visitedNode_count = 0;

    // topo order sequence.
    vector<int> topologicalOrder;

    // Declare queue and put all the initial nodes who has indegree zero.
    queue<int> q;
    for (int i = 1; i <= V; i++) {
        if (indegree[i] == 0)

}
```

### 10. Single Source Shortest Path for Undirected Graph(BFS+ Relextion) [O(V+E), O(V)]

```c
 /*
 Intuition:
    We can get SSSP, by simply perforing BFS, starting from "src" node. As we know that, each edge cost 1 unit, BFS explore nodes which care close the node(compare to DFS),
    so we can peform simple relexation,
            dist[it] = 1 + dist[node], if we have edge "node -> it", where "node" is visited and "it" we are exploring..
 */

 void shortestPath(vector<int> adjList[], int V, int src) {

    // Initalize the distance array with maximum distance.
    vector<int> dist(V + 1, INT_MAX);

    // src -> src, distance is zero.
    dist[src] = 0;

    // Use queue to perform BFS.

            if (dist[node] + 1 < dist[it]) {
                dist[it] = dist[node] + 1;

    }

    // print dist, hold the shortest distane for source node.
}
```

### 11. SSSP for Directed Acyclic Graph [O(V+E), O(V)]

```c
 /* Intuition:

     If there is graphs looks like, Z -> A -> B -> C, and we need to find SSSP with src node "A".

    So using topoOrder, we get the order in which we need to traverse the graph. Because it is
    obvious that, all the nodes who are reachable from src node "A", have dependency as src
    node "A", so in topoOrder src node "A" comes before these reachable nodes. and node Z is
    unreachable from A, so Z comes before A in topoOrder.

    Why It works ?
    - Toposort visit all the node first, which does not have any dependency on it. So by doing that we find
    all the nodes which can be reach from the source node. Because those node which are reachable from the source
    node, have dependency as source node... so first source node unwind during topo order iteration... later we can use
    the relaxation step to get shortest distnace.

    And node which can not reach by the source node is popped from the stack first(visited first in topo order) and have distane as INT_MAX(never relaxation happen on that).

    - And once any node distance is calculated(it is not INT_MAX) then we can use this node as intermidatory
    for others once. The node which is not reached by the source node distance is INT_MAX so it can never
    used as intermidatory node.

### 12 .Dijkstra algorithm SSSP (non-negative-edge)[O(V+E)*logE, O(V)]

```c
 /* Intuition:


Similar to other SSSP Problem, We start visiting nodes from "src" node. To decide which node to visit next, we use the
priority_queue which holds all promising nodes, and return the most optimistic node which have shortest distance till that time,
so using that node we perform the relxation on its' neighbors nodes(it).

Main idea is that,

    IN Priority_queue we hold this pair => {dist, node}, dist => distToSource

    PQ return a node, which have shortest distance from "src" node at any moment, so we visit that node first among
    all potential nodes, which are in queue. Mark that node as visited.

    So when we explore the neighbors nodes(it), with "node" as intermidatory node(which have shortest dist from src),

        we check, distToSource[node] + edgeCost(node->it) < distToSource[node],

                    if it is true, then we got better route to reach (it) node from (src) node via "node".

                        update the distance of,

                                distToSource[node] = distToSource[node] + edgeCost(node->it)

Time: O((V+E)logE) => In the worst case, we visit entire graph during relexation O(V+E), and pq holds all the edges(considering duplicates as well), so pq.top() take O(E) time)

### 14 Disjoint Set [O(4*alpha), O(V)]

```c
 /* Intuition:

 DisjointSet is Data Strcuture, which basically peroform this operation,
    union(u, v) =>  make nodes u and v part of same set.
    isPartofSameSet(u, v) => check both are part of same set or not.

Path Compression(Optimization):
    - So when we are finding the ultimate parent that time, it takes O(logN) time to get the parent. But,
    using path compression each node in path points to ultimate parent directly.. so next time when we get parent of any node
    from tha path.. we can get in O(1) time.

Why connect to smaller set to larger one ? (Think without considering path compression)
    - If we connect larger set to smaller set, in that case that findParent will take more
    time, because larger tree already have greater height than smaller one... so it height won't be
    increase...but if we add larger to smaller... we are increasing the height... which directly affect into time complexity.

But we know optimization... so above one is not much create any impact.

But wait if that's the case.. can we use the size of set instead of rank.

We will add the smaller set(by size) to the larger set.

---

Most of time it take O(1) and but new path is explored first time that time it take O(logN).

So amarotized tiem complexity is = O(4*alpha) = O(1) (constant) we can consider.

Time = O(4*alpha) = O(4) = Constant (for any operation )
Space = O(N)

### 16.  Kosaraju's Algorithm for Strongly Connected Components [O(N+E), O(N+E)]

```c

/* Intuition

The key idea is that the SCCs of the graph correspond to the SCCs of the graph's transpose.

With main graph we have scc likes; SCC1 -> SCC2 -> SCC3
With reverse graph we have scc likes: SCC1 <- SCC2 <- SCC3
So when we perform the DFS on transpose graph and start to explore the SCC2 nodes... all nodes of SCC1 are
visited because they are the first who popped out from the topo stack. So we can skip visited node(or we can say we can't update the low-link value(similar to tarjan algorithm))
And to achieve this behaviour, we start with node which explored at last(indirectly used that topo stack)

### 17. Tarjan's Algorithm for Strongly Connected Components[O(V+E), O(V)]

/* Intuition

Tarjan's algorithm is a single-pass DFS-based algorithm that finds SCCs using a depth-first search tree.
It uses a stack to keep track of the visited vertices and an array to record the low-link node
reachable from each vertex.

Graph is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1
And when we are at 3 and again try to visit 1 which is already visited that time...3 can reach to 1 which is lowest_id for 3.
It means 2 can also reach to 1. In short all are part of SCC.. because there is cycle and all can reach to each other through that cycle.


And we already knew that for directed graph to get all nodes which are in same-path,
we need stack & on_stack(array)(here) which keep track of which elements are on stack.


Using these two, we make sure SCC2 does not use low link value of SCC1, because SCC1 are already visited,
and not on stack.

### ### 20. Bellman Ford Algorithm (SSSP with negative cycle)[O(E * (N-1)), O(V)]

```c
/* Intuition

Why Bellman Ford Algorithm For SSSP, When there is already Dijkstra ?
- Dijkstras's Algorithm find SSSP correctly, if and only if there is no negative edge. There is chance that,
with negative edge as well, dijkstra give correct answer but not 100%. Another concern is that, if in graph
negative cycle is present then Dijkstrat won't work(each iteration we get the best node with negative dist).

Due to that, Bellman Ford Algorithm is used,
    - To get SSSP with negative edge
    - Detect negative cycle (if present we won't get SSSP for all nodes)

Intuition behind this algorithm is that,

    If there are V vertices in the graph, then shorest path from "src" node to any other node have maximum "V-1" edges.

    What we do is, we perform the edge relexations for all the edges, for V-1 times. Because in worst case, at each
    iteration we get one edge relexed and propagate that changes to last node, require V-1 iterations.

    After perform edge relexations V-1 times,

        We peform one more time, to check any of node dist[] got changed.

        If yes, then there is negative cycle present in graph.

        If no, we get the SSSP.

    If negative cycle present in graph,

        And to get all nodes affected due to that cycle, we can again perform V-1 times edge relexations, so

### 21. Floyd Warshall Algorithm (All pairs shortest path algorithm) [O(V^3), O(V^2)]

```c
/* Intuition


It use the "incremental path improvement".

=> Basically, It tell us that try every vertex as intermidatory node and choose the best one.

A1 -> A5 then I can try every vertex...
A1 -> A2 + A2 -> A5
A1 -> A3 + A3 -> A5
A1 -> A4 + A4 -> A5

Along with that,
The algorithm builds up the solution iteratively, improving path estimates step
by step by considering increasingly longer paths with more intermediate nodes.

It begins with no intermediate nodes and only considers direct paths. 
Then, it checks if adding one node as an intermediate node can improve 
the shortest path between pairs, then two nodes, and so forth.

iteration = 0 => direct edge (u -> v)
iteration = 1 => dp[u][v] => minimum((u -> i) -> (i -> v))
iteration = 2 => dp[u][v] => minimum((u->i->j) -> (j -> k -> v))
    What I mean is that, for iteration=2, when we again put all node as intermidatory
    node that time we are putting the chain of two nodes as intermidatory, because
    we are using the result of previous iteration. 
    Ex:
    A1 -> A3 => A1 -> A2 + A2 -> A3 => min(A1->A0->A2 , A1->A5->A2)(A1->A2)(This is already calculated and one of the lowest stored in A1->A2 so we use that) + A2->A3
  

And to propogate the change to every other node we need to peform same thing N(total_vertex) times. (incremental path build up)

A1 -> A2 -> A3 -> A4 -> A5... this is path.. okay during first iteration suppose A1 got updated with best value, which is
also works for all other nodes who is depend on that.. to propagate A1 change to A5 we need to peform same thing
5 times so each time one of the node got changes which can be propogate to next node during next iteration.
